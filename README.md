# python-challenge
For this project, python was used to read and analyse data from, and export data to, .csv files.
The skills demonstrated include: for loops, if statements, dictionaries, lists, and f-strings.

# PyBank
Financial data consisting of "Date" and "Profit/Losses" columns was analysed to calculate the following:
- The total number of months included in the dataset
- The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period
- The changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period, and the average of those changes
- The greatest increase and greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The financial dataset 'budget_data.csv' is located in the 'Resources' folder.

The python script used is titled 'main.py'.

The results are contained in the 'financial-analysis.txt' file located in the 'analysis' folder.

# PyPoll
Election data consisting of "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate" columns was analysed to calculate the following:
- The total number of votes cast
- The percentage of votes each candidate won
- The total number of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote

The election dataset 'election_data.csv' is located in the 'Resources' folder.

The python script used is titled 'main.py'.

The results are contained in the 'election_results.txt' file located in the 'analysis' folder.
